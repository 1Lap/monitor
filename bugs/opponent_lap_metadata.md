looks like opponent laps are being written with the local players metadata?

eg:
2025-11-20_08-47_Circuit_de_Spa-Francorchamps_Proton_Competition_#16_LM_Dean_Davids_lap1_t282s_20251120084731635025

for what I think is an opponent lap? It was written while I was still "in garage" before I'd joined the circuit.
