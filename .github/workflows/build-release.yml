# Build workflow disabled for monitor MVP
#
# The monitor is a simple Python script that doesn't need .exe packaging for MVP.
# We can add executable building back later if needed for easier distribution.
#
# Original build workflow archived at: _archive/docs/build-release.yml.disabled
#
# To re-enable executable building:
# 1. Create monitor.py entry point
# 2. Decide if we need GUI (probably not)
# 3. Update build script for monitor instead of tray_app
# 4. Test on Windows
# 5. Restore this workflow
#
# For now, monitor is distributed as Python source code:
# - Clone repo
# - pip install -r requirements.txt
# - python monitor.py
